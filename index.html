        <h1>Trying to learn Git</h1>

        <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It tracks changes in files and coordinates work among multiple people.</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Git Basics:</strong> Git is a tool for tracking changes in files, allowing you to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others, and manage project history.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Git Commands:</strong> Common commands include `git init` to create a new repository, `git add` to stage changes, `git commit` to save changes, and `git push` to upload changes to a remote repository.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Branching and Merging:</strong> Git allows you to create branches to work on features or fixes independently. You can merge branches to integrate changes back into the main project.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Remote Repositories:</strong> Git can connect to remote repositories (like GitHub) to share code with others, collaborate, and manage contributions.    
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Best Practices:</strong> Use meaningful commit messages, keep commits small and focused, and regularly push changes to remote repositories to ensure collaboration is smooth.
